# ClearSight - Facial Recognition System

A facial recognition web application built with React and Flask.

## Features
- Face detection and recognition
- User registration with photos
- Dashboard to view users and logs

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React, Axios
- **Backend**: Python Flask, OpenCV
- **Database**: SQLite

## Setup

**Backend:**
```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

**Frontend:**
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

Open http://localhost:3000

## How It Works

1. **Face Detection**: Upload an image or use webcam to detect faces
2. **User Registration**: Register users by capturing their face and basic info  
3. **Face Recognition**: The system compares new faces against registered users
4. **Results Display**: Shows recognition results with confidence scores


## Key Learning Concepts

This project demonstrates:

- **Full-Stack Development**: Frontend and backend integration
- **Computer Vision**: Face detection and recognition using OpenCV
- **REST API Design**: Clean API endpoints with proper HTTP methods
- **Database Design**: SQLite database with relationships
- **React Development**: Component-based UI with hooks
- **Docker Containerization**: Multi-service container setup
- **File Handling**: Image upload and processing
- **Error Handling**: Proper error responses and validation


## Demo

1. Start the application
2. Navigate to the Registration page
3. Enter your name and capture/upload a photo
4. Go to Recognition page
5. Upload a photo to test recognition
6. View results and user dashboard

## Future Enhancements

- Real-time webcam recognition
- Multiple face detection in single image
- User authentication system
- REST API improvements
- Mobile responsive design
- Performance optimizations

## What I Learned

Building this project taught me:
